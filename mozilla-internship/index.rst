Socorro: A Distributed System
=============================

.. figure:: /_static/breakpad.png

.. note::

    What is Socorro? Socorro is a distributed system for collecting,
    processing, and analyzing crashs reports generated by the Breakpad
    library.

An Internship Well Spent
========================

.. rst-class:: build

  1. Cleaning up the Build System
  2. Transitioning to Travis-CI
  3. Creating Native System Packages

.. note::

    My internship can be broken down into 3 distinct parts. The first is
    that I cleaned up the build system to remove unneeded dependencies
    and reduce duplicate runs. In the process this cut the build time in
    half.

    The second is supplementing the build system with Travis-CI. This
    allowed for multiple pull requests to be tested at once and reduced
    the turn around time for merging changes.

    Finally I created native system packages for easy installation and
    deployments of Socorro.

Reducing The Build Time
=======================

  * From 20 minutes down to 10 minutes
  * 10 minutes * average 215 builds a month = 2150 minutes saved a month
  * 2150/60 ~= 35.8333 hours ~= 1 week of work

  * Caching on Jenkins

    * pip-cache

  * Redundancies in Build

    * make -> bash -> make -> bash
    * immediate: bootstrap
    * found later: Django compression (webapp-django bootstrap)



Transitioning to Travis-CI
==========================

  * Adds parallelism to builds

    * Current PRs lock builds on Jenkins. Only one PR ran at a time.

  * Equivalent build time without reliance on internal Infra

    * All services are run locally on the Travis VMs.

  * Only allowed Ubuntu on Travis, which is divergent from our RHEL
    deploy.

  * Can ship off packages.

  * Caching dependencies cost extra


Creating Native Packages
========================

  * FPM super easy to use.

  * Now have RPMs

  * deploy.sh -> pre/post-install


Conclusion
==========
